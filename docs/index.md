[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ghiret/my_go_player/graph/badge.svg?token=GURIMLWFMA)](https://codecov.io/gh/ghiret/my_go_player)

Welcome to the documentation for the Deep Learning and Go Project. This project is a personal implementation and exploration of the concepts presented in the book "Deep Learning and the Game of Go" by Max Pumperla and Kevin Ferguson.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a learning exercise and a practical application of deep learning techniques in the context of the game of Go. It aims to implement various Go-playing bots, from simple random players to more advanced AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and neural networks.

## Key Features

- Implementation of Go game rules and board representation
- Various AI players, including random and MCTS-based bots
- Tools for generating and processing game data
- Integration with TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Comprehensive unit testing suite
