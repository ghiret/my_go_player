# my_go_player
This is my implementation of the go bot in the book Deep Learning and the Game of Go

This is a purely pedagocal project for me to familiarise myself with the techniques described in the book.

### How to play random bot vs random bot

```bash
poetry run python src/scripts/random_bot_vs_random_bot.py
```

### How to play against the random bot

```bash
poetry run python src/scripts/human_vs_random_bot.py
```
